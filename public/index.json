	"content": "How We Built a Flywheel to Steadily Improve Security for Amazon RDS by Joshua Brindle\nThis blog details the process an AWS security team undertook to secure a new feature, PL/Rust, on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). The author, a principal security engineer, explains how the team moved beyond a simple implementation to build a comprehensive, self-improving security system—a \u0026ldquo;flywheel\u0026rdquo;—that combines technology, process, and testing to protect customers.\nThe Pieces of the System The project\u0026rsquo;s central component was PL/Rust, an extension that allows users to write custom PostgreSQL functions in Rust that are then compiled into highly performant native machine code. The core of this extension is a library called postgrestd, which was designed to prevent database escapes. However, at the time, the library was new and had not yet been hardened for the realities of a large-scale production environment. The primary security challenge arose from the fact that PL/Rust compiles these extensions directly on the database instance itself. This design requires a full development toolchain to be locally available, significantly increasing the potential risk. A poorly constructed extension could destabilize the database or its host instance, and attackers could use various techniques to try and bypass security controls like the write xor execute (W^X) model. This context made it clear that a series of robust mitigations were necessary to provide this functionality to customers safely.\nChallenging the Approach The AWS culture of obsessing over operational excellence—with a focus on automation, resilience, and simplicity—heavily influenced the search for a solution. The team considered SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux), which was described as a long-debated option. SELinux is a set of kernel features that enforces mandatory access control (MAC), adding a powerful layer of protection on top of the standard authorization system. Using SELinux policies, an administrator can be extremely specific about what is allowed on a system, for instance, by preventing a process from writing to a file even if its ownership permissions would normally permit it. This level of deterministic control can greatly increase an operating system\u0026rsquo;s security. The trade-off, however, is reduced flexibility and the significant effort required to configure the access controls to meet specific security requirements. After a thorough internal debate, which involved senior leaders challenging the idea to anticipate future issues, the team agreed that for the PL/Rust use case, the benefits of SELinux outweighed the downsides. The decision was made to proceed with this approach.\nBuilding the Security Flywheel Simply implementing a tool wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough; the team built a complete, constantly improving process around it.\nEnforce and Monitor: They built the SELinux environment and created policies to lock down the system. Crucially, they configured these policies to send any denial messages to their internal telemetry systems for analysis. Respond: Working with the internal blue team, they developed specific incident response playbooks for the Amazon RDS team to investigate these denial messages. Test and Refine: The team began running quarterly \u0026ldquo;game days\u0026rdquo;. During these exercises, the red team would stage exploits against the system, and the service team would respond using their playbooks. Afterwards, all teams would analyze the response to find bottlenecks and areas for improvement. This cycle of enforcement, monitoring, response, and testing created a strong, well-oiled security machine.\nThe Flywheel in Action: A Real-World Example The effectiveness of this system was validated in a production environment. An SELinux denial message automatically generated a high-severity ticket for the service team. The system had worked as expected—it successfully blocked an unauthorized activity, acting as a proactive intrusion detection system. Even though the immediate risk was neutralized, the team\u0026rsquo;s process required them to investigate the root cause to see if the system could be improved further. The investigation eventually revealed that the activity was initiated by the research team at Varonis Threat Labs. AWS security then reached out to them to collaborate, demonstrating how a security event can lead to positive engagement with the research community. This incident provided a concrete and rewarding example of how the team\u0026rsquo;s work directly benefited customers.\nFor the security engineers involved, this was deeply validating, as it provided a concrete example of how their proactive work directly benefited customers by preventing a potential issue.\n"

	"content": "Create an SSL connection to Amazon RDS for Db2 in Java without KeyStore or Keytool by Vikram Khatri, Amine Yahsine, Ashish Saraswat, and Sumit Kumar\nThis article outlines a simplified method for establishing a secure SSL database connection in Java, specifically for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Db2. The approach allows developers to bypass the traditional complexities associated with the keytool utility and the management of Java KeyStores. The primary benefits of this technique include its simplicity, its suitability for automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, and its ability to maintain strong security through proper TLS 1.2 negotiation and server certificate validation.\nSolution Overview Instead of relying on a traditional Java TrustStore, this solution leverages a specific configuration property supported by the IBM JDBC driver. The driver can be instructed to use a PEM-formatted server certificate directly, which eliminates the need to convert the certificate or import it into a .jks file.\nThis is accomplished by setting the sslCertLocation property:\nproperties.put(\u0026#34;sslCertLocation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/certchain.pem\u0026#34;); To ensure the connection is encrypted and uses a secure protocol, the following JDBC driver connection properties must also be set:\nsslConnection=true sslVersion=TLSv1.2 This method is particularly well-suited for cloud environments like AWS, where Amazon RDS provides a PEM-formatted certificate bundle. The solution was tested with an IBM Db2 JDBC Driver (db2jcc4.jar v4.33.31), Java 11+, and a PEM certificate from Amazon RDS.\nPrerequisites Before implementing this solution, the following resources are assumed to be in place:\nAn Amazon RDS for Db2 server instance with SSL already enabled. A certificate chain PEM file, such as the region-specific us-east-1-bundle.pem available for download from AWS. A recent version of the IBM Data Server Driver (db2jcc4.jar version 4.33 or later). Java 8 or higher, with support for TLS 1.2. The Java Program The full source code for a Java program (Db2SSLTest.java) that connects to Amazon RDS for Db2 using this SSL method is provided below:\nimport java.sql.*; import java.util.Properties; public class Db2SSLTest { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length != 6) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Usage: java Db2SSLTest \u0026#34; + \u0026#34; \u0026lt;certchain.pem\u0026gt; \u0026#34; + \u0026#34; \u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;port\u0026gt; \u0026lt;database\u0026gt; \u0026lt;userid\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt;\u0026#34;); System.exit(1); } Properties properties = new Properties(); String certPath = args[0]; String hostname = args[1]; String port = args[2]; String database = args[3]; String userid = args[4]; String password = args[5]; properties.put(\u0026#34;sslConnection\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;); properties.put(\u0026#34;sslVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;TLSv1.2\u0026#34;); properties.put(\u0026#34;sslCertLocation\u0026#34;, certPath); properties.put(\u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, userid); properties.put(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;, password); String url = \u0026#34;jdbc:db2://\u0026#34; + hostname + \u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + port + \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; + database; try { Class.forName(\u0026#34;com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver\u0026#34;); Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, properties); Statement stmt = conn.createStatement(); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(\u0026#34;SELECT CURRENT \u0026#34; + \u0026#34; TIMESTAMP \u0026#34; + \u0026#34; FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1\u0026#34;); if (rs.next()) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;SSL Connection successful!\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Current timestamp: \u0026#34; + rs.getString(1)); } rs.close(); stmt.close(); conn.close(); } catch (Exception e) { System.err.println(\u0026#34;Error: \u0026#34; + e.getMessage()); e.printStackTrace(); } } } Compile and Run Assuming the IBM JDBC driver is located at ~/sqllib/java/db2jcc4.jar, the following shell script illustrates how to compile and run the Java program.

If an application connects to a single AWS Region, it is recommended to use a region-specific certificate file (e.g., us-east-1-bundle.pem). If there is an absolute requirement to use the global bundle, developers must revert to the traditional method of using keytool to store the certificates in a keystore.\nTroubleshooting The following are solutions to common issues:\nFailing SSL connection: If the SSL connection fails after being enabled in the RDS for Db2 instance, the instance must be restarted. The SSL enablement only takes effect after a restart. Unable to locate the db2jcc4.jar file: This file is included with various IBM DB2 client packages, such as the data server client or runtime client. Unable to connect to the RDS database: If a connection fails after cataloging a database with SSL using db2cli commands, there might be an existing database connection that is not aware of the newly cataloged database. The db2 terminate command should be used to close existing connections before testing again. Conclusion This post demonstrates that it is not always necessary to use the Java KeyStore or keytool utility to enable SSL connections. With a PEM certificate and a modern JDBC driver, a secure connection can be established with minimal setup. This approach is especially valuable for developers who need to perform rapid SSL testing, for automated environments such as CI/CD and containers, and for anyone looking to simplify secure Java-to-Db2 connectivity.\n"

	"content": "Enhance the local testing experience for serverless applications with LocalStack by Patrick Galvin and Debasis Rath\nThis article announces and explains new capabilities designed to simplify the local testing experience for serverless applications. Through an integration with AWS Partner, LocalStack, the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code now provides a more streamlined way for developers to build, test, and debug their serverless applications without leaving their development environment.\nChallenges with Local Serverless Development While serverless architectures are generally simple to operate and scale, the development and testing process can introduce friction that slows down the code-test-debug cycle. Developers often encounter several common roadblocks:\nSlow Iteration from Cloud-Based Validation: Previously, developers had to deploy AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) templates to the cloud just to test changes, which created significant delays in the feedback loop. Friction from Tool Context Switching: The need to constantly move between integrated development environments (IDEs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and resource emulators like LocalStack leads to fragmented and inefficient workflows. Complex Manual Setup: Manually configuring port mapping and making code edits for local integration tests can introduce inconsistencies between the local and cloud environments. Limited Service Integration Debugging: Troubleshooting Lambda functions that interact with other AWS services, such as DynamoDB or Amazon SQS, has traditionally required complex manual configuration, extending the time needed to resolve issues. Automated Setup Process The LocalStack VSCode Extension can be installed directly from the AWS Toolkit, which provides an intelligent wizard for a streamlined setup. This wizard automatically detects if LocalStack is configured and guides the user through the process. It also handles authentication through a browser-based flow and securely stores the token. Furthermore, the wizard checks for and creates the necessary AWS CLI profiles for LocalStack, allowing developers to easily switch between their local and cloud environments.\nTesting a Serverless Application The article demonstrates these capabilities with a practical example: an event-driven order processing system that uses API Gateway, Amazon SQS, Lambda, and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).\nWith the new integration, the entire workflow can be tested locally:\nDeploy Locally: The AWS SAM application is deployed to the local LocalStack environment using the LocalStack AWS profile. Debug Locally: Developers can set breakpoints in their Lambda function code directly in VS Code and use the integrated debugger to step through the execution as it interacts with other locally emulated services. Validate End-to-End: The complete workflow, from message ingestion at the API Gateway to the final notification from Amazon SNS, can be tested to confirm all service integrations work correctly before deploying to the cloud. For an in-depth technical demonstration of this LocalStack integration, refer to this youtube video.\nBest Practices for Local Testing To make the most of this new workflow, the article recommends a layered and strategic approach to testing. This involves starting with fast, isolated unit tests to validate core logic, and then progressively moving to broader integration and system-level validation.\nThe recommended testing strategy follows four main steps:\nBegin with local unit tests to focus on isolated function logic. Proceed to local integration testing using LocalStack to confirm interactions between AWS services. After local validation, test the application in the actual AWS environment to surface issues that cannot be emulated, such as IAM permission mismatches or VPC networking challenges. Finally, conduct performance and load testing in AWS to assess how the application handles real-world traffic. When to Use Local Versus Cloud Testing While local testing provides significant speed and cost advantages, it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand its limitations and when to test in the cloud. The following table lists potential use cases for each strategy.\nTesting Scenario Local Testing Cloud Testing Reason Function logic validation ✓ Fast feedback for core business logic Service integration testing ✓ Quick validation of AWS service interactions Rapid iteration during development ✓ Immediate feedback without deployment overhead Cost-sensitive development environments ✓ Minimizes cloud resource costs during development Offline development scenarios ✓ No internet connectivity required Performance and scalability testing ✓ Requires actual AWS infrastructure for accurate results IAM permission validation ✓ LocalStack doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully replicate IAM behavior VPC networking scenarios ✓ Network configurations can\u0026rsquo;t be accurately emulated Production-like load testing ✓ Real performance metrics only available in AWS Final validation before deployment ✓ Supports compatibility with actual AWS environment Conclusion The integration of LocalStack into the AWS Toolkit for VS Code significantly enhances the local development experience for serverless applications. By allowing developers to run and debug complex, multi-service applications directly in their IDE, this new capability helps reduce context switching, catch issues earlier, and lower development costs. This leads to faster test cycles and higher-quality deployments, all while keeping the developer in full control of their local environment.\n"

	"content": "VPC endpoints VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

Introduce the end-to-end Data Science pipeline, from data processing to model deployment. Offer hands-on experience with key AWS services like AWS Glue and Amazon SageMaker. Discuss practical considerations such as cost, performance, and the benefits of cloud vs. on-premise solutions. Speakers Văn Hoàng Kha – Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS Community Builder Bạch Doãn Vương – Cloud Develops Engineer, AWS Community Builder Key Highlights End-to-End Data Science Pipeline on AWS The workshop outlined the complete data science journey on the cloud, using core services:\nAmazon S3: For scalable data storage. AWS Glue: For serverless data integration, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and data cleaning. Amazon SageMaker: For building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale. Practical Demonstrations Demo 1: Data Processing with AWS Glue: Showcased how to process and clean a real-world IMDb dataset, emphasizing the importance of data quality for model accuracy. Demo 2: Model Training with SageMaker: Demonstrated the process of training and deploying a Sentiment Analysis model, making the abstract concepts of ML deployment concrete. Integrating Custom Models: Showcased how to leverage frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch within SageMaker, using a sample project from a provided GitHub repository. Broadening AI/ML Capabilities with Managed Services An overview of AWS\u0026rsquo;s pre-built AI services that accelerate development:\nAmazon Transcribe: Speech-to-text conversion. Amazon Comprehend: Natural language processing for sentiment analysis and topic extraction. Amazon Rekognition: Image and video analysis. Amazon Personalize: Building personalized recommendation systems. Key Takeaways Data-First Mindset Business-first approach: Always start with the business context of the data, as emphasized by the need for feature engineering. Data quality is paramount: The workshop stressed that the accuracy of any ML model is directly dependent on the quality of the input data. Data as an asset: Data collection, governance, and security are the foundational pillars of a data-driven organization. Technical Architecture Modular Pipeline: The standard architecture involves a pipeline from S3 (storage) to AWS Glue (ETL) to Amazon SageMaker (ML), allowing for a clean separation of concerns. Flexibility: AWS supports both low-code solutions like SageMaker Canvas and code-intensive custom model training using frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch. Serverless benefits: Using services like AWS Glue removes the need for managing infrastructure, allowing teams to focus on data and models. Strategy Phased approach: Start with data collection and cleaning before moving to complex model training. Cloud vs. On-premise: The discussion highlighted that the cloud offers significant advantages in scalability, pay-for-what-you-use cost models, and access to powerful computing resources without upfront investment. ROI Measurement: Leverage cloud benefits to reduce development time and infrastructure overhead, leading to faster time-to-market for AI-powered features. Applying to Work Automate ETL: Use AWS Glue to create automated data cleaning and preparation jobs for analytics and ML. Adopt SageMaker: Pilot Amazon SageMaker for training and deploying ML models to streamline the MLOps lifecycle. Implement Sentiment Analysis: Apply the concepts from the demo to analyze customer feedback from reviews or support tickets. Explore Pre-built AI: Integrate services like Amazon Rekognition for content moderation or Amazon Transcribe for call center analytics. Consolidate Knowledge: Build a small project based on the workshop\u0026rsquo;s guidance to reinforce the concepts learned. Event Experience Attending the \u0026ldquo;Data Science on AWS\u0026rdquo; workshop provided a valuable, hands-on journey into cloud-based machine learning. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers The speakers, both AWS Community Builders, shared practical insights and best practices from their real-world experience. Hands-on technical exposure The live demos of processing data with AWS Glue and training a model with SageMaker were extremely effective at translating theory into practice. Leveraging modern tools Explored the comprehensive AWS ecosystem for data science, understanding how different services fit together to form a cohesive pipeline. Learned about both fully managed AI services and the powerful customization options available within SageMaker. Lessons learned A solid data preparation strategy is non-negotiable for success in machine learning. AWS significantly lowers the barrier to entry for building and deploying sophisticated data science systems. Modern cloud platforms provide the flexibility to choose between low-code tools for speed and custom code for specific, complex requirements. Some event photos Overall, the workshop provided not only technical knowledge but also practical experience with building end-to-end data science pipelines on AWS, emphasizing the importance of data quality and the power of cloud-native ML services.\n"

	"content": "Real-Time Typing Challenge Platform TypeRush An AWS-Powered Architecture for a Multiplayer Typing App 1. Executive Summary TypeRush is an interactive web application that replicates the core experience of Monkeytype while introducing multiplayer functionality for live competitive typing sessions. Designed as a showcase of real-time web technologies and scalable cloud architecture, the platform combines a modern frontend experience with a serverless backend powered by AWS.\nUsers can create or join typing rooms, compete in real time, and view performance metrics such as Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and rankings. The application leverages React for the frontend, AWS Lambda and API Gateway (WebSocket) for real-time synchronization, and Amazon RDS for player data and Amazon ElastiCache for session data. It also leverages Amazon Bedrock to generate daily challenges. Amazon Cognito secures user access and authentication. The solution demonstrates how cloud-native services can deliver fast, scalable, and cost-efficient real-time applications without the need for traditional server management.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Existing typing platforms are often limited to single-player functionality, lacking real-time multiplayer interaction or open implementation examples. Most multiplayer solutions require dedicated servers or complex infrastructure, making them costly and difficult to maintain. For developers and enthusiasts, there is no accessible, serverless example demonstrating real-time synchronization, event-driven updates, and secure user management in one integrated system.\nThe Solution This project provides a serverless, real-time typing platform that allows multiple users to connect, type simultaneously, and see instant feedback on their progress. It is designed to be lightweight, cost-efficient, and scalable.\nBenefits and Return on Investment The project serves as both a developer learning platform and a user-facing application. It demonstrates best practices in event-driven architecture, WebSocket implementation, and cloud-based scalability at minimal operational cost. For users, it provides an engaging, social typing experience. For developers, it offers an educational reference for building serverless real-time systems.\nThe platform requires no ongoing server maintenance, ensuring:\nLong-term sustainability Rapid scalability Low operational overhead 3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a serverless AWS architecture to manage a real-time typing challenge application. Data is processed and stored using a variety of AWS services, and the frontend is a modern, responsive UI. The architecture is detailed below: AWS Services Used Amazon S3: Hosts the static frontend. CloudFront: Provides a CDN for the frontend and API. AWS WAF: Acts as a firewall for CloudFront. Route 53: Manages domain and DNS routing. Amazon Cognito: Handles user sign-in and sign-up. API Gateway: Serves as the entry point for microservices and connects to private ECS via VPC Link. AWS Lambda: Powers the record and text microservices and the WebSocket API for the game microservice. Amazon RDS: Stores records and leaderboards. DynamoDB: Stores text data. AWS Bedrock (Titan Text G1 Express): Functions as the LLM model for text generation. Amazon SNS: Manages notifications and alarms. AWS CloudWatch: Handles logging and monitoring. AWS Secrets Manager: Stores database and API secrets. Amazon ECS (Fargate): Hosts the core game backend. Elastic Load Balancer: Balances game service traffic. ElastiCache (Redis): Caches real-time game data. CodePipeline: Orchestrates builds and deployments. CodeBuild: Builds Docker images and Lambda services. ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Stores Docker images. GitLab: Triggers pipeline builds. Component Design Frontend Layer: A modern, responsive UI built with React, hosted on Amazon S3, and served via Amazon CloudFront with AWS WAF and Amazon Route 53 for enhanced performance, global content delivery, and robust security. API \u0026amp; Real-Time Communication: AWS API Gateway serves as the unified gateway for both REST and WebSocket APIs, implementing rate limiting, authentication, and request validation. The WebSocket API powers real-time multiplayer interactions. Compute \u0026amp; Business Logic: AWS Lambda handles serverless processing tasks like data persistence and AI-powered text generation. Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate hosts containerized backend services, including the game server. VPC PrivateLink connects API Gateway to ECS Fargate containers, and an Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic. Data Layer: Amazon RDS stores relational data like user profiles and leaderboards. Amazon DynamoDB manages non-relational data such as dynamically generated text. Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) provides in-memory caching for frequently accessed data. Authentication \u0026amp; User Management: Amazon Cognito handles secure user registration, authentication, and authorization, supporting social and federated login. Amazon Secret Manager secures storage for secrets like API keys. CI/CD \u0026amp; DevOps: AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline enable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) across all application components, automating build, test, and deployment processes. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases This project has two parts—setting up the cloud infrastructure and building the application—each following 4 phases:\nBuild Theory and Draw Architecture: Research and design the AWS serverless architecture. Calculate Price and Check Practicality: Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs and adjust if needed. Fix Architecture for Cost or Solution Fit: Tweak the design to stay cost-effective and usable. Develop, Test, and Deploy: Code the application and AWS services, then test and release to production. Technical Requirements Frontend: Practical knowledge of React. Backend: Experience with AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, Fargate, RDS, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache. CI/CD: Familiarity with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and GitLab. Infrastructure as Code: Use AWS CDK/SDK to code interactions. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline\nMonth 1: Study all about AWS and AWS services. Month 2: Start planning for the project and the AWS services to implement. Month 3: Develop, implement, and launch. 6. Budget Estimation \u0026mdash;\u0026gt; Budget Estimation File \u0026lt;\u0026mdash;\nInfrastructure Costs AWS Services: Amazon Route 53: $0.90 AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF): $9.03 Amazon CloudFront: $0.40 ($0 with free tier) S3 Standard: $0.11 ($0 with free tier) Data Transfer: $0.00 ($0 with free tier) Amazon API Gateway: $15.92 ($0 with free tier) Amazon Cognito: $0.00 Network Load Balancer: $18.49 AWS Fargate: $8.88 AWS Lambda: $0.02 ($0 with free tier) Amazon ElastiCache: $16.06 Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL: $39.37 ($0 with free tier) AWS Bedrock (Workload 1): $2.63 DynamoDB: $0.03 ($0 with free tier) AWS Secrets Manager: $4.00 AWS CodePipeline: $1.00 ($0 with free tier) AWS CodeBuild: $5.00 ($0 with free tier) With free tier account: about $60/month With paid tier account: about $122/month Both amounts assume 24/7 running services; in reality, it might be much lower.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Technical Integration: Medium impact, medium probability. Performance and Scalability: High impact, medium probability. Cost Management: Medium impact, medium probability. Security: High impact, low probability. Data Reliability: Medium impact, low probability. Operational Risks: Low impact, medium probability. Learning Curve: Medium impact, high probability. Mitigation Strategies Technical Integration: This risk is mitigated by phased implementation and adherence to AWS best practices. Performance and Scalability: Optimizing WebSocket communication, leveraging Redis caching, and monitoring with CloudWatch will help maintain responsiveness. Cost Management: These can be controlled through AWS Budgets, usage alerts, and auto-scaling policies. Security: Risks will be minimized using AWS WAF, Cognito, Secrets Manager, and strict IAM policies. Data Reliability: Clear data ownership boundaries and transactional writes will ensure consistency. Operational Risks: Risks in CI/CD pipelines will be reduced with staged deployments and rollback configurations. Learning Curve: The learning curve will be addressed through dedicated study and hands-on practice in the first project phase. Contingency Plans If the service fails: A maintenance page will be displayed to users. If multiplayer is too slow: Multiplayer mode will be temporarily disabled, but single-player will remain active. If costs spike unexpectedly: The change that caused the spike will be immediately reversed. If a new update breaks the site: The system will automatically revert to the previous working version. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements: Upon completion, the project will deliver a scalable, secure, and fully functional real-time multiplayer typing platform built entirely on AWS.\nLong-term Value: It will demonstrate best practices in serverless architecture, event-driven design, and CI/CD automation. For users, it provides a smooth, engaging multiplayer typing experience. For us, it serves as our first hands-on, practical reference model for building real-time, serverless web applications on AWS with minimal cost and maintenance.\n"

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

Shifting from a reactive, post-development security model to a proactive approach where security is embedded in every phase. This cultural shift is the core of DevSecOps, aiming to balance development speed with system security. Phases of a Secure DevOps Lifecycle A comprehensive, seven-phase approach to embedding security throughout the pipeline:\nPlan: Define security requirements and perform threat modeling. Code: Use static analysis (SAST) tools to detect vulnerabilities early. Build: Automate security checks, dependency scans, and configuration validation. Test: Integrate penetration testing and compliance auditing. Deploy: Scan Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure secure environments. Operate: Automate patching, incident response, and remediation. Monitor: Use real-time analytics and AI-powered anomaly detection for proactive defense. Leveraging AI in the DevOps Toolchain Automation: AI automates repetitive tasks like code review, log analysis, vulnerability scanning, and filtering false positives. Enhanced Security: AI-driven tools can prioritize critical risks, suggest fixes, and detect anomalous behavior in runtime environments. Efficiency: AI assists in generating documentation, reports, and compliance policies, reducing manual workload. Tooling Examples: The session highlighted tools like SonarQube, Checkov, Prometheus, and GitHub Actions, along with AI\u0026rsquo;s role in enhancing their capabilities. AWS Tools for AI-Enhanced DevOps Amazon CodeGuru: A service demonstrated to scan code for vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, secret leaks) and provide actionable recommendations for fixes. AWS Managed Control Plane (MCP) \u0026amp; Base (MCB): Tools for automating security compliance and updates for Terraform and Kubernetes (EKS) configurations.

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3. "

	"content": "Summary Report Event Vision To provide a strategic guide to Generative AI, from the foundational principles of large language models to the sophisticated art of prompt engineering. To unlock the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for building AI that is grounded in proprietary, real-time data. To introduce the next evolutionary step in AI: autonomous, goal-oriented agents that can reason and act. To unveil Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, a comprehensive platform designed to bridge the chasm between AI prototypes and secure, scalable production systems. Speakers Lam Tuan Kiet – Sr. DevOps Engineer, FPT Software Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi – AI Engineer, Renova Cloud Dinh Le Hoang Anh – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey Key Highlights A Glimpse into the Future \u0026ldquo;The journey of AI is an evolution in autonomy.\u0026rdquo; This central theme framed the entire workshop, charting a course from simple AI assistants that follow rules to fully autonomous Agentic AI systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows with minimal human oversight.\nPart 1: Mastering the Fundamentals with Amazon Bedrock The Foundation Model Revolution: The session began by contrasting traditional ML models with the broad, general-purpose Foundation Models (FMs). Amazon Bedrock was positioned as the secure gateway to a diverse range of cutting-edge FMs. The Art of the Prompt: Prompt Engineering was deconstructed as the skill of communicating effectively with an AI. The session covered a spectrum of techniques from Zero-Shot and Few-Shot to advanced Chain-of-Thought prompting. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Grounding AI in Reality: RAG was presented as the critical technology for enterprise AI. By using embedding models like Amazon Titan to convert private data into vector representations, RAG allows the AI to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information before generating an answer, combating hallucinations and tailoring responses to specific business contexts. Part 2: The Evolution into Autonomous Agents Bridging the Prototype-to-Production Chasm: The speakers identified the critical hurdles that prevent promising AI prototypes from becoming valuable business tools: Performance, Scalability, Security, and Governance. The Rise of Agentic AI: The workshop then pivoted to the future: AI Agents. These are not just chatbots; they are systems designed to achieve specific goals by automating entire workflows, leveraging open-source frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Crew.AI. Part 3: Introducing Amazon Bedrock AgentCore The Production-Ready Platform for Agents: The highlight of the event was the introduction of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, a comprehensive platform designed to solve the production chasm. AgentCore provides all the foundational services needed to run agents securely and at scale: Runtime \u0026amp; Identity: Securely execute and manage agent operations. Memory: Provide agents with context for coherent interactions. Tools: Equip agents with a Browser Tool to access live web data and a Code Interpreter to perform calculations. Gateway: A secure entry point for agents to interact with company APIs. Observability: Gain deep operational insights into agent performance, cost, and behavior. From Theory to Practice: The Live Demos and Code Blueprints The workshop transcended theory by grounding every concept in practical, hands-on code, referencing two key GitHub repositories as invaluable resources for attendees.\nThe Foundational Cookbook: aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples This official AWS repository was presented as the essential \\\u0026ldquo;cookbook\\\u0026rdquo; for mastering the core components of Bedrock. The demos showcased how this collection of Jupyter notebooks and code samples provides a flight simulator for AI development, allowing engineers to:\nExperiment with Prompting: Explore dozens of examples for Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting across different models like Claude and Llama. Build a RAG Pipeline from Scratch: Step-by-step guides demonstrated how to use Amazon Titan to create embeddings, store them in a vector database, and build a complete, functional RAG pipeline for Q\u0026amp;A over private documents. Master the APIs: Provide clear, reusable code snippets for interacting with virtually every feature of the Bedrock service, from text generation to image creation. The Capstone Project: ihatesea69/Bedrock_AgentCore This repository served as the capstone demo, illustrating how to assemble the individual components from the \\\u0026ldquo;cookbook\\\u0026rdquo; into a sophisticated, functioning AI agent using the new AgentCore platform. The live demonstration walked through this repository to showcase how to:\nDefine an Agent: Structure the agent\u0026rsquo;s identity, instructions, and goals in code. Equip the Agent with Tools: Grant the agent the ability to perform actions beyond text generation, such as calling external APIs or interpreting code. Orchestrate a Mission: Tie everything together in a live example where the agent receives a complex request, autonomously chooses the right tools, retrieves necessary information, and executes a multi-step plan to achieve its goal. This made the abstract concept of \\\u0026ldquo;Agentic AI\\\u0026rdquo; tangible and achievable. Key Takeaways Your Quick-Start Blueprint: Applying This to Your Work Build a RAG-Powered Expert: Clone the amazon-bedrock-samples repository and adapt the RAG notebooks to connect to your own internal documentation, creating a powerful, context-aware internal search engine. Prototype Your First Agent: Use the Bedrock_AgentCore repository as a template. Define a simple agent that automates a multi-step business process unique to your team, such as generating a daily sales report by calling an internal API and summarizing the results. Refine Prompts with the Cookbook: Take an existing AI workflow and use the diverse examples in the amazon-bedrock-samples repo to upgrade your prompts from simple instructions to sophisticated, few-shot examples, dramatically improving output quality. Explore AgentCore Tools: Investigate how the tools within Bedrock AgentCore, like the Browser Tool or Code Interpreter, could solve a specific business problem that requires live data or dynamic calculations. Event Experience This workshop was a fascinating journey through the entire landscape of modern AI. The inclusion of comprehensive GitHub repositories transformed it from a theoretical lecture into an actionable masterclass. Attendees left not just with knowledge, but with the specific code blueprints needed to begin building the next generation of AI-driven applications immediately.

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor (you saved when doing section 4.3) Click Add another record, and add a second record using the following values. Click Create records when finished to create both records. Record name: *. Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

	"content": "Summary Report Event Objectives Instill the DevOps mindset, covering its culture, principles, and key performance metrics. Provide a deep dive into building CI/CD pipelines using native AWS DevOps services. Teach Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using AWS CloudFormation and the AWS CDK. Explore the AWS container ecosystem, including Docker, Amazon ECR, ECS, EKS, and App Runner. Demonstrate how to implement comprehensive monitoring and observability using CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray. Speakers Bao Huynh - AWS Community Builder Thinh Nguyen - AWS Community Builder Vi Tran - AWS Community Builder Van Hoang Kha – Cloud Engineer, AWS Community Builder Key Highlights From Manual Operations to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) The workshop highlighted the pitfalls of \u0026ldquo;ClickOps\u0026rdquo; (manual console-based management), such as being slow, error-prone, and difficult to replicate. AWS CloudFormation: Introduced as the native IaC solution, using YAML/JSON templates to define and manage AWS resources in \u0026ldquo;Stacks\u0026rdquo; and its ability to detect configuration drift. AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK): Presented as a developer-centric IaC framework that allows defining infrastructure in familiar programming languages (e.g., Python, TypeScript), using reusable \u0026ldquo;Constructs\u0026rdquo; to accelerate development. Building a Full CI/CD Pipeline A complete, automated pipeline was demonstrated using the suite of AWS developer tools: AWS CodeCommit: For secure source control. AWS CodeBuild: For automated builds and testing. AWS CodeDeploy: For managing complex deployments like Blue/Green and Canary releases. AWS CodePipeline: To orchestrate the entire release process from source to deployment. Containerization and Orchestration The session covered the fundamentals of containerization with Docker and the importance of a container registry like Amazon ECR for storing and scanning images. A detailed comparison of orchestration services was provided: Amazon ECS: An AWS-native, simpler solution deeply integrated with the AWS ecosystem, ideal for teams wanting lower operational overhead. Amazon EKS: A managed Kubernetes service that aligns with the open-source standard, offering greater flexibility and multi-cloud portability at the cost of higher complexity. AWS Fargate \u0026amp; App Runner: Serverless compute options that remove the need to manage underlying servers for containers, simplifying deployment and operations. Monitoring and Observability The importance of full-stack observability was emphasized for maintaining and debugging distributed systems.

AWS X-Ray: Demonstrated for distributed tracing to analyze and debug performance bottlenecks in microservices architectures. Key Takeaways Design Mindset Automate Everything: Transition from manual \u0026ldquo;ClickOps\u0026rdquo; to a fully automated IaC approach to ensure consistency, speed, and reliability. Infrastructure as Code is Non-Negotiable: IaC is the foundation for modern DevOps, enabling collaboration, versioning, and reproducibility of environments. Choose the Right Tool for the Team: The choice between CloudFormation, CDK, ECS, and EKS should be based on team skills, ecosystem needs, and the desired balance between simplicity and control. Technical Architecture CI/CD Pipelines: Every project should have an automated pipeline that handles code integration, testing, and deployment to ensure rapid and safe releases. Container-First for Microservices: Use containers to package applications and their dependencies, and an orchestrator (ECS or EKS) to manage them at scale. Full-Stack Observability: Implement a robust monitoring strategy with metrics, logs (CloudWatch), and distributed tracing (X-Ray) to gain deep insights into application performance and health. Modernization Strategy Phased Adoption: Introduce DevOps practices incrementally. Start by converting one manual process to IaC or building a CI/CD pipeline for a single service. Leverage Serverless: Use serverless options like AWS Fargate and App Runner to reduce operational complexity and allow teams to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure management. Measure What Matters: Focus on key DevOps metrics like Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, and Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) to drive continuous improvement. Applying to Work Automate a Deployment: Convert a manually deployed application to use an AWS CodePipeline workflow. Codify Infrastructure: Define an existing S3 bucket or EC2 instance using an AWS CloudFormation template or a CDK application. Containerize an Application: Create a Dockerfile for a web application and push the image to Amazon ECR. Pilot a Container Service: Deploy a simple containerized application using AWS App Runner or ECS with the Fargate launch type. Improve Observability: Create a CloudWatch Dashboard for a critical application and configure alarms for key metrics like CPU utilization and error rates. Event Experience Attending the \u0026ldquo;DevOps on AWS\u0026rdquo; workshop was extremely valuable, offering a comprehensive and practical guide to implementing modern DevOps practices on the cloud.\nLearning from highly skilled speakers The AWS Community Builders provided deep, practical knowledge, breaking down complex topics into understandable concepts.

	"content": "When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.

AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"
