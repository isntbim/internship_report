Blog I have translated:

###  [Blog 1 - How We Built a Flywheel to Steadily Improve Security for Amazon RDS](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog details the process an AWS security team undertook to secure a new feature, PL/Rust, on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). The author, a principal security engineer, explains how the team moved beyond a simple implementation to build a comprehensive, self-improving security system—a "flywheel"—that combines technology, process, and testing to protect customers.

###  [Blog 2 - Create an SSL connection to Amazon RDS for Db2 in Java without KeyStore or Keytool](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog outlines a simplified method for establishing a secure SSL database connection in Java, specifically for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Db2. The approach allows developers to bypass the traditional complexities associated with the keytool utility and the management of Java KeyStores. The primary benefits of this technique include its simplicity, its suitability for automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, and its ability to maintain strong security through proper TLS 1.2 negotiation and server certificate validation.

###  [Blog 3 - Enhance the local testing experience for serverless applications with LocalStack](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog announces and explains new capabilities designed to simplify the local testing experience for serverless applications. Through an integration with AWS Partner, LocalStack, the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code now provides a more streamlined way for developers to build, test, and debug their serverless applications without leaving their development environment.
