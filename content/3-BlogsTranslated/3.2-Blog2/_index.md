# Create an SSL connection to Amazon RDS for Db2 in Java without KeyStore or Keytool

> by Vikram Khatri, Amine Yahsine, Ashish Saraswat, and Sumit Kumar

This article outlines a simplified method for establishing a secure SSL database connection in Java, specifically for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Db2. The approach allows developers to bypass the traditional complexities associated with the `keytool` utility and the management of Java KeyStores. The primary benefits of this technique include its simplicity, its suitability for automated environments like CI/CD pipelines, and its ability to maintain strong security through proper TLS 1.2 negotiation and server certificate validation.

---

## Solution Overview

Instead of relying on a traditional Java TrustStore, this solution leverages a specific configuration property supported by the IBM JDBC driver. The driver can be instructed to use a PEM-formatted server certificate directly, which eliminates the need to convert the certificate or import it into a `.jks` file.

This is accomplished by setting the `sslCertLocation` property:

```java
properties.put("sslCertLocation", "/path/to/certchain.pem");
```

To ensure the connection is encrypted and uses a secure protocol, the following JDBC driver connection properties must also be set:

```java
sslConnection=true
sslVersion=TLSv1.2
```

This method is particularly well-suited for cloud environments like AWS, where Amazon RDS provides a PEM-formatted certificate bundle. The solution was tested with an IBM Db2 JDBC Driver (`db2jcc4.jar` v4.33.31), Java 11+, and a PEM certificate from Amazon RDS.

---

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this solution, the following resources are assumed to be in place:
- An Amazon RDS for Db2 server instance with SSL already enabled.
- A certificate chain PEM file, such as the region-specific `us-east-1-bundle.pem` available for download from AWS.
- A recent version of the IBM Data Server Driver (`db2jcc4.jar` version 4.33 or later).
- Java 8 or higher, with support for TLS 1.2.

---

## The Java Program

The full source code for a Java program (`Db2SSLTest.java`) that connects to Amazon RDS for Db2 using this SSL method is provided below:
```java
import java.sql.*;
import java.util.Properties;
public class Db2SSLTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    if (args.length != 6) {
      System.out.println("Usage: java Db2SSLTest " +
        " <certchain.pem> " +
        "  <hostname> <port> <database> <userid> <password>");
      System.exit(1);
    }
    Properties properties = new Properties();
    String certPath = args[0];
    String hostname = args[1];
    String port = args[2];
    String database = args[3];
    String userid = args[4];
    String password = args[5];
    properties.put("sslConnection", "true");
    properties.put("sslVersion", "TLSv1.2");
    properties.put("sslCertLocation", certPath);
    properties.put("user", userid);
    properties.put("password", password); 
    String url = "jdbc:db2://" + hostname + ":" + 
        port + "/" + database;
    try {
      Class.forName("com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver");
      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, 
                          properties);
      Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
      ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT CURRENT " +
          " TIMESTAMP " +
          " FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1");
      if (rs.next()) {
        System.out.println("SSL Connection successful!");
        System.out.println("Current timestamp: " + 
           rs.getString(1));
      }
      rs.close();
      stmt.close();
      conn.close();
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```

## Compile and Run

Assuming the IBM JDBC driver is located at `~/sqllib/java/db2jcc4.jar`, the following shell script illustrates how to compile and run the Java program. The script also includes a function to retrieve the database password from AWS Secrets Manager or prompt the user for it manually.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Retrieves the master user password for a specified DB instance.
# This function attempts to obtain the master user password for the provided
# DB instance ID. It first checks if the password can be retrieved from the
# AWS Secrets Manager. If a valid secret is not found, it prompts the user
# to manually enter the password.

## Considerations

There is a limitation in the JDBC driver (at the time of writing) that prevents the use of a global certificate bundle (like `global-bundle.pem`) with the `sslCertLocation` property. If an application connects to a single AWS Region, it is recommended to use a region-specific certificate file (e.g., `us-east-1-bundle.pem`). If there is an absolute requirement to use the global bundle, developers must revert to the traditional method of using `keytool` to store the certificates in a keystore.

---

## Troubleshooting

The following are solutions to common issues:
* **Failing SSL connection:** If the SSL connection fails after being enabled in the RDS for Db2 instance, the instance must be restarted. The SSL enablement only takes effect after a restart.
* **Unable to locate the `db2jcc4.jar` file:** This file is included with various IBM DB2 client packages, such as the data server client or runtime client.
* **Unable to connect to the RDS database:** If a connection fails after cataloging a database with SSL using `db2cli` commands, there might be an existing database connection that is not aware of the newly cataloged database. The `db2 terminate` command should be used to close existing connections before testing again.


---

## Conclusion

This post demonstrates that it is not always necessary to use the Java KeyStore or `keytool` utility to enable SSL connections. With a PEM certificate and a modern JDBC driver, a secure connection can be established with minimal setup. This approach is especially valuable for developers who need to perform rapid SSL testing, for automated environments such as CI/CD and containers, and for anyone looking to simplify secure Java-to-Db2 connectivity.
