### Week 8 Achievements:

* Practiced Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation by deploying a foundational VPC, multi-tier web stack, and iteratively evolving the stack with additional resources such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, and multi-region deployments.

* Improved understanding of resiliency and scaling:
  * Used AWS Fault Injection Simulator to design and run experiments that injected faults and observed application behavior.
  * Configured Auto Scaling groups, launch templates, and load balancers to handle load changes and recover from failures, including automated instance replacement based on health checks.

* Refactored and extended application architectures:
  * Broke down a monolithic application into multiple microservices (Advert, Invoice, ShoppingCart, Order, User, Static) and validated end-to-end functionality.
  * Built and deployed a serverless Single Page Application backed by API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, with a CI/CD pipeline using CodeStar.
  * Added authentication and authorization with Amazon Cognito and integrated AWS X-Ray to trace requests and analyze performance.

* Explored AI and content services:
  * Integrated Amazon Polly for text-to-speech through the console, CLI, and SDK.
  * Used Amazon Rekognition for image object detection and basic facial recognition scenarios.
  * Implemented a chatbot with Amazon Lex, including deployment, enhancement, Lambda-based fulfillment, and publishing.
  * Hosted a static website on S3, secured it with appropriate access settings, and accelerated delivery with CloudFront; practiced S3 features like versioning and cross-region replication.

* Enhanced monitoring and observability skills:
  * Built CloudWatch dashboards with metric widgets and Logs Insights to visualize application and infrastructure health.
  * Monitored both Windows and Linux EC2 instances by tracking CPU, network, and other key metrics under synthetic load.

* Completed the scheduled assessment for the week and consolidated knowledge from reliability, serverless, AI services, and monitoring topics.
