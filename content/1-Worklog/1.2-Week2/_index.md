### Week 2 Objectives:

* Define and scope the first typing game project (core features, microservice boundaries, future matchmaking).
* Establish team foundation: shared repo, initial backlog, ER diagrams, tech stack, ownership.  
* Standardize WPM and accuracy formulas.  
* Prototype FastAPI service: text generation, sentence assembly, chat; validate Bedrock integration path.  
* Set up AWS Budgets with alerting.  
* Gain working proficiency: Lambda (function URL), VPC (subnets, gateways, peering vs transit), Flow Logs, load balancing concepts.  
* Provision Amazon RDS; design schema and seed dataset for text retrieval.  
* Refactor text service to DB-backed retrieval; benchmark vs prior API method.  
* Introduce early operational practices: role assignment, benchmarking, monitoring for scalability.
