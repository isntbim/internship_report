### Week 7 Achievements:

* Gained hands-on experience with Amazon DynamoDB by creating tables, loading data, working with GSIs and composite keys, and enabling backups and change data capture with Streams and Kinesis.

* Applied cost and analytics practices using DynamoDB performance analysis and AWS Glue + Athena to review cost and usage data and experiment with tagging for allocation.

* Configured identity federation and IAM governance:
  * Set up Azure AD federation to AWS, synced IAM roles, and tested federated console access.
  * Created IAM groups, users, and roles with conditions such as IP address and time-based restrictions.

* Optimized AWS cost and database migrations by reviewing Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, and practicing schema conversion and data migration with AWS SCT and DMS, including monitoring and Serverless options.

* Deployed and managed applications on Lightsail and containers by running WordPress, Prestashop, Akaunting, and Lightsail container services, including snapshots, alarms, and Docker-based custom images.

* Orchestrated workflows and application access:
  * Built workflows with AWS Step Functions using Task, Choice, Wait, Retry/Catch, and Parallel states.
  * Compared IAM access keys with IAM roles and attached an EC2 role for secure S3 access.

* Used Cloud9 and Elastic Beanstalk for application lifecycle, from creating a Cloud9 environment and running CLI tasks to deploying and updating a monolithic app on Elastic Beanstalk and wiring a release pipeline with CodeStar, CodeCommit, and CodeDeploy.

* Strengthened account and organizational security:
  * Reviewed root account protection, MFA, and a dedicated IAM admin user and group.
  * Defined password policies, explored SCPs, and used IAM Access Analyzer and last-accessed data to refine permissions.

* Built and refined microservices and security controls by creating Lambda-based microservices with DynamoDB and Step Functions, automating deployment with CodeStar, and deploying GuardDuty, Security Hub, Detective, and multiple network/data protection services (VPC design, Network Firewall, WAF, Shield Advanced, Macie, KMS, ACM, Secrets Manager).
