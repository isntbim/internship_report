### Event Experience

Attending the **“Kick-off AWS First Cloud Journey”** workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a solid foundation of essential concepts, the practical skills to start building, and the inspiration to continue my lifelong learning journey in the cloud. Key experiences included:

#### Learning from highly skilled speakers
The event provided a multi-faceted learning experience, blending high-level industry vision with practical, on-the-ground career advice. We received a strategic overview of the cloud's future from Nguyễn Gia Hưng, Head of Solutions Architect at AWS Vietnam, and gained deep insights into the crucial role of DevOps from Đỗ Huy Thắng, DevOps Lead at VNG. This was perfectly complemented by the relatable and inspiring stories from program alumni, who shared their personal journeys from being students to becoming specialized professionals like a GenAI Engineer and a Cloud Engineer. Hearing directly about "a day in the life" and the transition from the program into a full-time tech role provided a clear and tangible picture of the path ahead.

#### Networking and discussions
From the moment of check-in to the dedicated tea break, the atmosphere was buzzing with energy. There were invaluable opportunities to connect with fellow students who will be our peers and collaborators throughout this On-the-Job Training program. Beyond peer networking, the final Q&A session was a highlight, allowing us to directly engage with the speakers and mentors. This open forum provided a chance to ask specific questions about career paths, technical challenges, and personal development, turning the one-way flow of information into a dynamic and collaborative discussion.

#### Lessons learned
Three core lessons stood out from the event. First, cloud computing is the foundational launchpad for modern careers, not just a single destination; it's the gateway to specializations in AI, DevOps, Security, and Data. Second, the journey is a marathon, not a sprint. The diverse stories from the alumni emphasized that this program is a critical first step, but continuous learning and resilience are what shape a successful career. Finally, community is a powerful accelerator. The event solidified that we are now part of a larger ecosystem-the AWS Builders community-where collaboration and shared knowledge are essential for growth.
